# AI Engineering — 30 Day Plan (PyTorch, HF, LangChain)

This repo contains a 30-day hands-on plan for AI engineering using **PyTorch**, **Hugging Face**, and **LangChain**.
Each day has a notebook: `notebooks/dayXX/dayXX.ipynb` with explanations, runnable code, and exercises.
Some exercises are intentionally open-ended to encourage deeper learning.

## Windows Quickstart
1. Install Python 3.10 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Open Command Prompt and navigate to this folder.
3. Run: `setup.bat`
4. Activate venv: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
5. Launch Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`

## Linux/Mac Quickstart
1. Run: `bash setup.sh`
2. Activate: `. .venv/bin/activate`
3. Launch: `jupyter notebook`

## Repo structure
- `notebooks/day01` ... `notebooks/day30` — daily notebooks
- `datasets` — small sample datasets
- `requirements.txt`, `setup.sh`, `setup.bat`

## How to use
Open the notebook for the current day and follow the cells. Commit your work frequently.
